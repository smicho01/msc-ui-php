        <h3>Welcome to AcademiChain</h3>

        </p>

        <h2>What is AcademiChain ?</h2>

        <p>The goal of AcademiChain is to help students ask questions anonymously (without revealing their real identity)
            and get answers to the questions asked to improve the learning process.</p>
        <p>Our goal was to build a student community around a given school/college, because not every educational
            institution has a system that would allow those who feel embarrassed to ask questions, no matter for what reason.</p>
        <p>If your answer to a question is considered correct and the best answer, you will be rewarded with tokens
            that can be used in other potential applications such as the one created for
            example <a href="http://sever3d.synology.me:4001/" target="_blank">ItemXchanger</a>.</p>

        <h2>How to earn Tokens ?</h2>

        <p>To earn Academi Tokens, answer questions correctly. If the question author thinks your answer is the best and chooses your answer, you will be rewarded with Academi Tokens and your rank will increase</p>

        <h2>Can I use tokens outside AcademiChain ?</h2>

        <p>Yes. The blockchain on which the tokens are stored is an independent application. Other potential applications such as the aforementioned ItemXchanger
            allows the transfer of tokens between wallets. In short, the exchange of tokens for tangible or intangible goods. </p>

        <p><b>Please, note</b> that AcademiChain does not support or promote piracy or copyright infringement.
        We are not responsible for goods exchanged on ItemXchanger. Any suspicious offers noticed will be
            removed and the accounts of users of transactions will be blocked on AcademiChain.</p>
